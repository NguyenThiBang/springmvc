/*
 * The AdminController has been split into multiple controllers for better organization:
 * 
 * - AdminDashboardController: Dashboard statistics and overview  
 * - AdminProductController: Product management
 * - AdminCategoryController: Category management
 * - AdminOrderController: Order management
 * - AdminUserController: User management
 *
 * This provides better code organization, maintainability, and separation of concerns.
 * Each controller now handles a specific area of admin functionality.
